        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Lauren, I'm 23 years old, and I'm from here in Ottawa. Originally,  I had applied to the broadcasting program at Algonquin College, but when that program was suspended I was offered a spot in IMD. Without any experience with the content of the program, I was worried I would be over my head. Luckily, so far I've found the program engaging and I'm excited to continue.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, I have two cats that both enjoy causing trouble for me and for each other. In my own time, I enjoy playing video games and using HTML tags such as <sup>superscript</sup>, <em>emphasis</em>, and <abbr title="Which could stand for something">abbreviation</abbr> in sentences in natural and unforced ways.</p>
